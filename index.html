        <p>4.Soak the almonds or cashews for 1 to 2 hours and use.</p>
        <p>5.The color of your gravy may differ based on your red chili powder. you may want to arrange for a good chili powder that is less hot like kashmiri chilli powder and salt.</p>
        <p>6.Grill the chicken in the oven or stove top. For grilling in oven,preheat the oven to 240 C for at least 15 min. Skew the chicken on to soaked wooden skewers or place on a greased tray and grill for 20 to 30 min. Flip the chicken to the undone side once one is done.</p>
